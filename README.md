# SimpleWeatherApplication
 Mobile Application Deveopler assignment
 
 Designed for iOS (swiftUI)

SPECIFICATION

Create a simple weather application that, when opened, queries a weather service API, and returns a list of 5 cards that displays the 5-day (inclusive) forecast.
Each forecast card should include:

    • The date forecasted (e.g., Monday, May 1)
    • High and low temperature
    • Probability of precipitation
  
Include a refresh button that will re-query the service and update the forecast.

You may choose any location when requesting the forecast data from the API; output the location chosen in the header of the application.


API USAGE

Any weather service API can be used; some examples include:

    • https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api
    • https://api.weather.gc.ca/
    • https://open-meteo.com/
    • https://openweathermap.org/ (API key required)
    • https://www.weatherapi.com/ (API key required) Reference the API used in the footer of the application.


PLATFORM

The application should be written for iOS or Android. React Native can be used, so long as the application can be demonstrated in a simulated mobile environment.

The application does not need to be published to an app store or deployed online; a shared screen walkthrough on a locally simulated device is sufficient.

In addition to a demonstration of the working application, please be prepared to walkthrough the application source code.
